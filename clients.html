  I have a huge depth of experience working with a number of high-profile,
  venture-backed startups in San Francisco.

      I came on board to help CircleCI finish an in-flight project to extract
      their public website, <a href="https://circleci.com">circleci.com</a>,
      from the internal app that serves their core product. Decoupling the
      pubic-facing static site from the customer-facing web application allowed
      the marketing team to iterate faster on landing pages and freed up the
      engineering team to focus their energy on core product feature development.

      We implemented a large Jekyll installation (~250 pages), including full
      migration of their previous managed WordPress blog. Along the way we
      built out numerous new or redesigned site pages, audited existing code
      and standardized the site layout, and documented it all for future
      developers with a thorough style guide including component examples and
      code samples.

        &ldquo;I worked closely with Todd for several months as he helped us migrate and
        overhaul our front end platform. Todd fit right in with our team and had
        an immediate impact. Not only was Todd's work top-notch, but he also
        worked quickly and efficiently. He helped build a platform that would set
        us up for future success and always provided us great ideas and best
        practices for the design and structure of our site. Todd is very easy to
        work with and was extremely professional to deal with. I would highly
        recommend Todd and hope to work with him again in the future.&rdquo;

      I joined Remind for an 8-month engagement to augment their growth team
      during a busy time. Remind makes a messaging app for teachers to keep in
      touch with students and parents safely and easily. With 35 million users
      and 2 billion messages handled to date, they have serious scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked on a variety of growth-oriented product features (A/B testing,
      strategic email engagement), mostly in Rails and Angular, with some Node
      mixed in.

    <p>
      I joined Leap Motion in the run-up to their big initial product launch,
      joining a nascent web team (4th member) that later grew to 12+. Our main
      task was building <a href="https://apps.leapmotion.com">Airspace</a>, the
      company&rsquo;s app store for motion-compatible apps. On launch day, the
      company shipped over 100,000 devices all over the world. Airspace saw
      over 1 million app downloads in its first 3 weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of the 10-month engagement, I spent most of my time
      interviewing and onboarding the full-time employees that would take over
      the projects and replace the team of consultants.

        &ldquo;Todd was one of my most reliable and high integrity developers
        at Leap Motion, and I know he can deliver high quality on a deadline. I
        have great respect for Todd&rsquo;s ability to think like a long term
        owner even on short-term engagements.&rdquo;

      I worked at TaskRabbit as a full-stack software engineer for 1.5 years,
      working on a wide variety of product features in Rails and Javascript.

      One of the projects I'm most proud of was a hack day project for ordering
      on-demand In-N-Out delivery. The project got
      <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/in-n-out-delivery-service-offered-in-san-francisco-by-burgerto-me/">a ton of</a>

      and set new records in the company's business metrics.
