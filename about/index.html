  <p>I'm a startup software engineer. I love building useful things that help people solve their problems. I value simplicity and clarity in design, good user experience, and quality products.</p>
  
  <p>Currently I ply my trade at <a href="http://www.taskrabbit.com/">TaskRabbit</a> (a service marketplace that helps people do more of what they love). Before that, I cofounded Duostack (a Ruby/Node.js hosting platform), which was acquired by <a href="http://www.dotcloud.com/">dotCloud</a> in May 2011.</p>
  
  <p>I'm a 2008 graduate of <a href="http://cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> where I studied information systems, statistics, and sleep deprivation. I also hold a master's degree from the Heinz College at CMU in Information Systems Management.</p>
  
  <p>While at CMU, I transformed the fledgling student-run campus television station into one of the most prominent and fastest-growing student organizations on campus. After interning at <a href="http://boeing.com/">Boeing</a> in Seattle, I joined a <a href="http://www.fooala.com/">young startup</a> as co-founder and technical lead. This is where I began to intensely develop my Ruby and Javascript expertise.</p>
  
  <p>When I'm not working, I like to <a href="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/hs279.ash1/20671_583420523479_4803440_34005652_7766763_n.jpg">fly airplanes</a> and build <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2187/2888525522_6c77d73ba3_z.jpg">high-precision electro-mechanical systems</a>, and <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3021/2888517968_4393ed6ed9_z.jpg">fly those too</a>. I also enjoy <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5499838/binder-clips-as-cable-catchers-redux">clever hacks</a> (for good, not evil), <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/">lolcats</a>, and <a href="http://www.wendys.com/food/Product.jsp?family=2&product=79">crispy chicken deluxe sandwiches</a> from Wendy's.</p>
  
  <p>If you'd like to talk about any of those things, don't hesitate to <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01X5dvct3G1lV6RQ7I9o926Q==&amp;c=yFCF6ggEo7qzlyMWQVdFAUqwmfpJZjiknbdqfnRmPEk=" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k\07501X5dvct3G1lV6RQ7I9o926Q\75\75\46c\75yFCF6ggEo7qzlyMWQVdFAUqwmfpJZjiknbdqfnRmPEk\075', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;">get in touch</a>.</p>
