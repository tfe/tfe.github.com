<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
  Hello, <a href="/about">my name is Todd</a>. I&rsquo;ve been consulting for <a
  href="/clients">San Francisco tech companies</a> for four years, helping them
  do more, move faster, or level up their teams. Maybe I can help yours?
</p>

<h3>How I Work</h3>
<p>
  I generally do three types of engagements: 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Team Augmentation:</strong> I integrate into an existing team to help
  them get more done, provide expertise, or just fill in until they can find a
  full-time hire. These are usually 3&ndash;5 days per week and last anywhere
  from a couple weeks to a several months.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>On-Call Developer:</strong> Are you in marketing or customer service
  and tired of begging the engineering team for help with every website change
  you want to make? I run into this scenario all the time and I can help! We
  can set you up with a block of hours every month for all the odds-and-ends
  tasks that need to get done but you don&rsquo;t want to burden your product
  team with.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Project Based:</strong> If you have a project you need developed, I
  can take it from designs and mockups to a market-ready product. Whether you
  don&rsquo;t have a dev team or just want to free them up to work on other
  things, I can help. These engagements are usually a couple weeks&rsquo; worth
  of concentrated work and a couple extra days for follow-up and iteration.
</p>

<h3>Rates</h3>
<p>
  I typically do bill for my time (&ldquo;time and materials&rdquo;) on a
  <strong>day rate of $2000 ($250/hour)</strong>. I require a minimum of one
  day for any project.
</p>
