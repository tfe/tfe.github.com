  <p>
    I&rsquo;m a startup software engineer. I love building useful things that help
    people solve their problems. I value simplicity and clarity in design, good
    user experience, and quality products.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently I am available for freelance work in San Francisco (feel free to
    <a href="mailto:todd@toddeichel.com">get in touch</a>). In the past, I've
    worked at <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com">Leap Motion</a> and
    <a href="http://www.taskrabbit.com/">TaskRabbit</a>. Before that, I cofounded
    Duostack (a Ruby/Node.js hosting platform), which was acquired by
    <a href="http://www.dotcloud.com/">dotCloud</a> in May 2011.
  </p>

  <p>
    I&rsquo;m a 2008 graduate of <a href="http://cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>
    where I studied information systems, statistics, and sleep deprivation. I
    also hold a master&rsquo;s degree from the Heinz College at CMU in
    Information Systems Management.
  </p>

  <p>
    While at CMU, I transformed the fledgling student-run campus television
    station into one of the most prominent and fastest-growing student
    organizations on campus. After interning at
    <a href="http://boeing.com/">Boeing</a> in Seattle, I joined a
    <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/original/0006/3341/63341v1.png">
    young startup</a> as co-founder and technical lead. This is where I started
    developing my Ruby and Javascript expertise.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I&rsquo;m not working, I like to
    <a href="/images/flying-1.jpg">fly</a>
    <a href="/images/flying-2.jpg">airplanes</a>
    and build <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2187/2888525522_6c77d73ba3_z.jpg">high-precision
    electro-mechanical systems</a>, and
    <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3021/2888517968_4393ed6ed9_z.jpg">fly those too</a>. I also enjoy
    <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5499838/binder-clips-as-cable-catchers-redux">clever hacks</a> (for good, not evil),
    <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/">lolcats</a>, and <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/">double
    doubles</a> from In-N-Out.
  </p>
