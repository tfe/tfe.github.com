<p>
  I&rsquo;m a startup software engineer. I love building useful things that
  help people solve problems. I value simplicity and clarity in design, good
  user experience, and quality products.
</p>

<p>
  Currently I am available for consulting work in San Francisco or remotely
  (feel free to <a href="mailto:todd@toddeichel.com">get in touch</a>). I've
  worked with <a href="/clients">a number of high-profile, venture-backed
  startups</a> doing full-stack web application development in Ruby and Javascript.
  Before that, I cofounded Duostack (a Ruby/Node.js hosting platform), which
  was acquired by <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> (then dotCloud)
  in May 2011.
</p>

<p>
  I&rsquo;m a 2008 graduate of <a href="http://cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>
  where I studied information systems, statistics, and sleep deprivation. I
  also hold a master&rsquo;s degree from the Heinz College at CMU in
  Information Systems Management.
</p>

<p>
  When I&rsquo;m not working, I like to
  <a href="/images/flying-1.jpg">fly</a>
  <a href="/images/flying-2.jpg">airplanes</a>
  and build <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2187/2888525522_6c77d73ba3_z.jpg">high-precision
  electro-mechanical systems</a>, and
  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3021/2888517968_4393ed6ed9_z.jpg">fly those too</a>.
  I also enjoy travel hacking, double doubles from In-N-Out, cats, and Oxford commas.
</p>
